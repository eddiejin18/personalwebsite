        <p>22 years old, Korean American and grew up in Scottsdale, Arizona until I was 9 where I moved to Palos Verdes, CA.</p>
        
        <p>Currently a senior at UC San Diego studying Mathematics-Computer Science & Business Economics.</p>
        
        <p>In my free time I enjoy meeting new people, watching soccer and watching Tottenham lose.</p>
        
        <p><em>Grew up playing games.</em> Everything from Pokémon to Call of Duty. Probably too much in High School—but hey here's some peak achievements:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Top 2000 in US Valorant</li>
            <li>Top 500 world Apex Legends</li>
            <li>Top 100 world for Player Unknown's Battlegrounds</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Directed a lot of that competitive energy to college after I didn't know what I wanted to do in life during and post-covid.</p>

        <p>Joined a student-run micro-VC fund called Crescent Fund where I learned the ropes of early stage investing and met some lifelong friends. Went from investor to managing partner in 8 months but ultimately ended up leaving to join Dorm Room Fund. Did an internship with Spero Ventures crafting a thesis around energy and manufacturing which is where I started to get really interested in American dynamism. Also angel investing into friends on the side and scout seed+ startups for <a href="https://hummingbird.vc" target="_blank">hummingbird.vc</a>.</p>

        <p>On the operating side, I worked at a few campus startups doing growth & marketing across EdTech & MedTech (<a href="https://evt.ai" target="_blank">EVT</a>, <a href="https://oceansideperspective.org" target="_blank">Oceanside Perspective</a>, and Neuretix): most of which probably won't end up going anywhere. I ended up landing product internships in legaltech at Relativity and currently at Fileread, an HF0 startup as PM #1.</p>

        <p><em>Genuinely love to build relationships with new people. Please feel free to reach out anytime.</em></p>
