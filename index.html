        <p>Hey there! I'm 22, Korean-American, and spent my early years in Scottsdale, Arizona before moving to Palos Verdes, California at 9. Right now, I'm a senior at UC San Diego studying Math-Computer Science and Business Economics.</p>
        
        <p>Fun fact: back in high school, I was super into competitive gaming and managed to hit:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Top 2000 in the U.S. for Valorant</li>
            <li>Top 500 globally in Apex Legends</li>
            <li>Top 100 in the U.S. for PUBG</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>I don't play games much anymore, but they taught me a lot about competition and grinding.</p>

        <p>In college, I found my way into the startup world by joining Crescent Fund, a student-run micro-VC. I went from being an investor to Managing Partner in 8 months, learning tons and making lifelong friends along the way. Later, I joined Dorm Room Fund, which has been a wild ride.</p>

        <p>Last summer, I interned at Spero Ventures, where I got deep into energy and manufacturing, and that's where my obsession with American dynamism began. On the side, I've been angel investing in friends' startups and scouting Seed+ deals for <a href="https://hummingbird.vc" target="_blank">Hummingbird Ventures</a>.</p>

        <p>I've done growth & marketing for a few random EdTech & Medtech startups on campus like <a href="https://evt.ai" target="_blank">EVT.ai</a>, <a href="https://oceansideperspective.org" target="_blank">Oceanside Perspective</a>, and Neuretix.</p>

        <p>Now, I'm focused on product. I did an internship at Relativity in legaltech, and I'm currently PM #1 at Fileread, an HF0 startup. Basically, I talk to lawyers and build & design AI products that make their lives easier.</p>

        <p><em>When I'm not working or studying, I love meeting new people, watching soccer (and sadly watching Tottenham lose), and having good convos over coffee. I'm all about building relationships and connecting with cool people. If you ever want to chat, brainstorm, or just say hi, don't hesitate to reach out. I'd love to hear from you!</em></p>
