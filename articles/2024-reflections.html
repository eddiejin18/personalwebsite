        <p>2024 was <i>unreal</i>. Met some amazing people, including my girlfriend. Relationships felt different—like my personal and professional lives were finally starting to converge. For the longest time, I kept those worlds siloed on purpose, but maybe they don't need to be. Time will tell if it'll drift back to how they were, but for now, things are fine.</p>

        <p>Life has shifted dramatically since summer, and it's remarkable how quickly we adapt to new realities—to the point where our old lifestyle becomes almost unrecognizable. I've grown considerably, or at least I'd like to think so. I didn't know how I wanted to write this. At first I considered listing my accomplishments, but that felt unnatural and unlike me. Rather, I want to share some meaningful reflections from this year.</p>

        <p style="margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: 40px; margin-left: 20px;">1. Follow your own path. Trust your gut.</p>

        <p>This past year, I've crossed paths with some incredibly smart people—many my age or even younger—doing what feels like the impossible. I'm proud of them, no doubt, but it's hard not to feel a step behind sometimes. Urgency and insecurity have a way of creeping in like that.</p>

        <p>But conversations helped me realize that everyone has their thing—some shine in engineering, some in art, some in writing. As for me, I'm still figuring it out. Maybe I'm a generalist, decent at a few things, but one thing I do know for sure: I'm exceptional at building strong relationships. What excites me isn't always what excites others—that's been a lesson of its own. We're all wired differently, and that's more than okay. The key is to trust your wiring and let it spark in its own way.</p>

        <p>Probably a bit of the Dunning-Kruger effect mixed in there too.</p>

        <p style="margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: 40px; margin-left: 20px;">2. Always give more than you take.</p>

        <p>It sounds obvious, but looking back, all the best relationships I've built this year started with some kind of giving. And what's funny is how often that giving loops back around in ways I never expected—leading to opportunities that never would've crossed my path otherwise. Give for the sake of giving. <i>Give for the sake of giving.</i></p>

        <p style="margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: 40px; margin-left: 20px;">3. Creativity as a lever for holistic growth.</p>

        <p>Whenever people ask what my hobbies are, I never have a good answer. But when I think about the people I admire most, they're always creative in some fashion be it writing, philosophy, or storytelling. Sure, there's a cultural obsession with logical thinking—math, physics, and biology—but creative thinking is what drives movement across the board. Distribution, design, problem-solving, even engineering—it all feels rooted in the ability to think abstractly.</p>

        <p>I keep coming back to this Patrick Collison quote: "One of the main things you should try to achieve by age 20 is some sense for which kinds of things you enjoy doing." Although I'm past that age, that's exactly why I started writing—it's a late but intentional pursuit of creativity and hopefully an answer to that question. I'm genuinely excited for the year. 2025 will be <i>real</i>.</p>

        <p style="opacity: 0.7; margin-top: 40px;">- Eddie</p>
